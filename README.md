### **ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Justin;**
A Computer Science student at UGA // aspiring software engineer in Metro Atlanta.

I primarily write in Java and Kotlin, but have experience with C++ and Python too.

With an ever-growing idea log and rapidly developing technology to back up my wildest ambitions, I'm beyond excited to see where the next few years take me in the field. In the meantime, I'm leading and building some exciting new projects with DevDawgs (a club I've founded) and beginning to work on a mobile app idea I've been tossing around for a while.

When I'm not developing, I'm dabbling in a variety of art forms like music production, graphic design, and photography, all of which can be found on [my website](https://www.justinquinnb.com).
