### Hey, I'm Justin
A hobbyist developer based in Metro Atlanta. I primarily write in C++ and Python, although I have some past experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that comes in handy at times.
I'm currently developing a custom bot for my private Discord server and have plans to create a game or mobile app sometime in the future.

When I'm not developing, I'm dabbling in a variety of art forms like music production, graphic design, and photography, all of which can be found at [my website](https://www.justinquinnb.com).
